const body =`This mixtape displays one of my favorites things about Lil B, rapping over pretty much any beat imaginable. There’s so many wildly different samples and beats; this is perfect for someone who wants somewhere to start with Lil B’s vast discography.

You immediately get some samples here you will pretty much never see any other rapper even attempt. On “Lone Warrior”, you get a beautiful Orchestral Japanese sample from “Dearest” by Ayumi Hamasaki with Lil B rapping about being alone, hoping God will protect from people with evil intentions. Right after, you get a really solemn sample of “I Guess I’m Floating” by M83. This track has an extremely hazy feel, as if waking up from a night of drugs, and realizing a shallow life ultimately leaves him alone, “My life is okay, fuck hoes all day, taking trips to Norway/
I can’t complain/ This shit is like a dream, but I’m never waking up/ I guess I’m always asleep…where’s my bed?/ Thinking deeper thoughts, where’s my head?/ 30 minutes before the show, where the fuck’s my bread?/ I feel like I’m God, I’m in the world alone/ Someone help me please”.

At the end of 2010 around Evil Red Flame’s release, Lil B had hit his stride and had just become pretty successful. Here we get a Lil B that had just made it and there’s a constant theme of Lil B discussing how the devil’s trying to fuck with everyone around him and how he tries his best to stay true and not fall into any dark temptations that come with success.  On “What’s 100 Dollers” (this album is chock  full of smooth lush soul samples) Lil B goes over a common idea you’ll see throughout his more serious tracks:  “What’s a 100 dollars/ what does it mean to you? / is it nothing, or would you die for it?” And here we get another one of my favorite aspects of Lil B, sincerity and authenticity. He isn’t spewing random bullshit, he’s laying out all his own thoughts here.

MOST BASED TRACK OF THE ALBUM: “Last Summer”. The sample on this track is completely insane, and Lil B destroys it. You just gotta listen to it, ‘nuff said.

There’s plenty of quirky, upbeat stuff on here as well though, it’s not all just downers here, particularly after track 21. On “They Love Me” (this sample is dope as fuck but I got no idea what it’s from) we got a happy Lil B always keeping his head cause he knows he got his based fam behind him. After track 21, it gets kinda erratic. We start with the classic cooking track “Think Im BasedGod” is on here as well. “Rich Bitch (Remix)” and “Happy New Year” have the most devil sounding beats on here, former sounding hard with latter sampling heavy metal. Some of the lyricism is typical Lil B silliness. “Slangin Yayo” is one of those rare tracks with one of Lil B’s amazing sung choruses. And this mixtape cannot be reviewed without mentioning “Hipster Girls”, which samples Daft Punk and is just Lil B at his weirdest, another where you just gotta listen to it.

Overall this mixtape is really good but some of the tracks do get samey and loses a lot of cohesion towards the end, which are common issues on Lil B’s projects as they tend to be rather long. Nevertheless this something no Lil B fan should miss out on. Lil B frequently gets criticized for poor rapping abilities, but they’re pretty decent here and he hits some pretty good flows on throughout a lot of these tracks. Even just within one mixtape you can see the two vastly differing sides of Lil B: “Last Summer” vs “Think Im BasedGod” is a good example of these styles. `
